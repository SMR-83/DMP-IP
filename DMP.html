                <p>This is the study protocol that contains information about the data that is to be collected during the clinical trial. The data management plan is based on the information in this protocol, with one key difference being that this project is assumed to take place at University College Cork instead of in Canada. <br/>Pages 10-12 of the protocol elaborate on the particular data that is to be collected. <br/>
